In his interview with Vargas, O\\'Connor reveals his belief that McKinney is bisexual. "I know of an instance where he had a three-way, two guys and one gal," he said. "Because he did it with me." &gt;O\\'Connor added, "I know he\\'s bisexual. There ain\\'t no doubt in my mind. He is bisexual." &gt;McKinney\\'s former girlfriend Price says she now believes that as well. "He was always into trying to talk me into having a three-way with one of his guy friends," she said. &gt;In her prison interview with McKinney, Vargas asked McKinney directly whether he had had any sexual encounters with men. McKinney said no. &gt;Displaying a strong aversion to homosexual sex was a tactic McKinney tried at his trial. His lawyers developed a so-called "gay panic defense," claiming homosexual abuse McKinney suffered as a child caused him to overreact to a sexual advance by Shepard and triggered the violent attack. &gt;Hoping a Wyoming jury would be sympathetic to gay panic did not pay off. McKinney was found guilty and wound up with two life sentences, assuring he\\'ll spend the rest of his life in prison, the same sentence received by his accomplice Russell Henderson. &gt;"It\\'s really hard for me to talk to Russ," McKinney said. "To see him in this situation, knowing that I\\'m the one that put him here." &gt;But Henderson said he realizes he bears responsibility for Shepard\\'s death. &gt;"For a long time I thought that his death wasn\\'t my fault. And then, as time has gone on, I got a better understanding to know that I could have prevented it and I could have stopped it, but I didn\\'t. Matthew died because I didn\\'t stop it," he said. &gt;Henderson also expresses regret and remorse for his actions that night. "I\\'m sorry to the Shepard family. They\\'ve had the hardest of all this. I\\'m sorry to the nation as a whole because this affected a lot of people and I wish every day I could change or fix it," he said.']\

There are no rallies celebrating this, there are no real public mentions of this. It is a passive "oh", really, save for two or three organisations. The apathy is in the fact that now is a pivotal moment, and no one seems to be taking any form of action. Now is a chance to unify the community and rally for action, but nothing is happening. Why is that ? Apathy, perhaps ? Or is it ignorance, as many of the younger LGBTQ community often finds themselves unaware of Matthew\\'s story, or do not take an interest in the history of the gay community (poll time: how many people know the history of Stonewall ? Not many, unfortunately). Now is a good time to do something, but no one wants to, and I think it is apathy.']\
