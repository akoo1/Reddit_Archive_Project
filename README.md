# Reddit Archive Project

#### Question: 
How has language regarding  the LGBT+ community changed over time?

#### Introduction
Societal views regarding the LGBTQ+ community have been historically negative, but within the last decade, attitudes regarding the community have begun to shift. Over time, our research portrays an increase in accepting language and a decrease in words with a negative connotation. We used data from the Reddit Archive ranging from January of 2009 to May of 2015 in order to research the shift in language. Researching how the LGBTQ+ community is spoken about and how that language has changed over time is critical in understanding the difficulty for the community to be the granted public acceptance that it needs to tackle the large- scale discrimination it is plagued with.


#### Dataset and Workflow:
The data we used to conduct our research is from the Reddit Archive from January of 2009 to May of 2015. The data was stored on ManeFrame II, a shared high-performance computing environment implemented by Southern Methodist University. The reason we chose the data during this period of time is because the M2 database only has Reddit Archive from October of 2007 to May of 2015.
